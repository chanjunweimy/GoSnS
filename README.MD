# GoSnS
GoSnS, which stands for **Go Simple and Satisfy**, is an application that is able to holistically resolve the existing in-flight problems by addressing 3 main target groups - ``Passengers, Cabin Crews and Managers``. A successful integration can provide interactive interface for passengers, efficient operation for cabin crews and informative insights to the higher management.
